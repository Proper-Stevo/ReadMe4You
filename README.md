## Description
Using Node Js I was able to create a series of questions and bascally create a promp questionaire to create a README file. Using Inquierer is definetely something to get use to and great practice. Calling functions and varaibles through other folders using export and require is something new to me and I enjoyed learning this.

## Installation 
Some of the NPM packages we had to install were inquiere and the just motify the questions in JS to say what it would promp. Aside from the Inquiere packakge we also included git-ignore.

## Usage 
The prupose of using this promp is to simply create a read me on the go and not use template every time. This way you just write what everything is and the node js creates it for you.

## Credits 
Thank you to the tutors i've had the last two weeks. Staying after class to ask questions and using all the office hours I can use.
